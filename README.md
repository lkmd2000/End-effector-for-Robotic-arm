# End-effector-for-Robotic-arm

- The goal of this design **-End effector-** is to join it to the robotic arm, holding a Knife for a wrestling between two robots to pop the other balloons.
- I recommend to have a look at the **" sum of the end effector"** STL file at the beginning , to understand the concept.

The design was created by **Autodesk Fusion 360** computer software, consists of three parts as following:

---
## PART 1:
- It is the main body of the design that will conect both Part 1 and Part 2.
- I uploaded a separate file for this part so it can be viewed.
- useing 3 features: Extrude, Extrude cut and a Fillet for all the ends.

## PART 2:
- It is the end of the design that will conect to the robotic arm.
- I uploaded a separate file for this part so it can be viewed.
- useing 3 features: 2 Extrude for different plans and sketch, in addition of a Fillet for all the ends.

## PART 3:
- It is the end of the design that will conect to the Knife or other combat tool.
- I uploaded a separate file for this part so it can be viewed.
- useing 3 features: 2 Extrude for different plans and sketch, in addition of a Fillet for all the ends.

---
- This design have been created as a task for the **" smart methods "** witch is a national commercial corporation.
- This task is in the mechanical engineering bath.
