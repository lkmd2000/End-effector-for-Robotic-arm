# End-effector-for-Robotic-arm

I recommend to have a look at the **" sum of the end effector"** STL file at the beginning , to understand the concept
The design was created by Autodesk Fusion 360 computer software, consists of three parts as following:
---
**1. PART 1:**
- It is the main body of the design that will conect both Part 1 and Part 2.
- I uploaded a separate file for this part so it can be viewed.
- useing 3 features: Extrude, Extrude cut and a Fillet for all the ends.

2. PART 2:
- It is the end of the design that will conect to the robotic arm.
- I uploaded a separate file for this part so it can be viewed.
- useing 3 features: 2 Extrude for different plans and sketch, in addition of a Fillet for all the ends.

3. PART 3:
- It is the end of the design that will conect to the Knife or other combat tool.
- I uploaded a separate file for this part so it can be viewed.
- useing 3 features: 2 Extrude for different plans and sketch, in addition of a Fillet for all the ends.

This design have been created as a task for the **" smart methods "** witch is a national commercial corporation.
This task is in the mechanical engineering bath.
